### 5. Persistent Header Visibility
Ensure the site header remains visible even when users scroll down, as its absence could reduce indirect brand marketing opportunities.

### 7. Consistent UI Design
Harmonize the user interface across all pages. For example, the design disparity between these two pages detracts from the user experience:
- [Green Card Guide](https://www.immigrationdirect.com/green-card-guide/)
* To recreate: Just go to `www.immigrationdirect.com` then click on the `Green Card`.
