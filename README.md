## Product Improvements

### 1. Adopt Material UI
Material UI has gained significant traction, particularly following the release of Android 12. Its modern design principles align with user expectations, enhancing user engagement and experience.

### 5. Comprehensive Risk Analysis
Expand risk assessment features to provide users with a holistic analysis of their circumstances.

### 6. Persistent Header Visibility
Ensure the site header remains visible even when users scroll down, as its absence could reduce indirect brand marketing opportunities.

### 7. News Page for Immigration Updates
Create a dedicated page for news and updates related to immigration, keeping users informed of relevant current events.

### 8. Consistent UI Design
Harmonize the user interface across all pages. For example, the design disparity between these two pages detracts from the user experience:
- [Green Card Guide](https://www.immigrationdirect.com/green-card-guide/)
- [Home Page](https://www.immigrationdirect.com/)
